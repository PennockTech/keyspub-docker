keyspub-docker
==============

<https://keys.pub/> is a new service, which comes with a big warning:
**This project is in development and has not been audited.**

I've taken my code from
<https://github.com/PennockTech/keybase-docker>
for making and running a Docker image and translated it for use with
`keys.pub` instead.

I'm putting no more documentation than that here at this time, since the
service, unaudited, is not suitable to recommend for others at this time.
(That's my excuse for being lazy.)
